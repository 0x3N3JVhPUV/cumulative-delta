You need to install it using npm (Node Package Manager). Also, since you are using TypeScript, you need to install the type definitions for express. Here is how you can do it:\n\nFirst, initialize npm in your project if you haven't done so already. You can do this by running the command `npm init -y` in your project root directory. This will create a `package.json` file in your project root.\n\nThen, install express and its type definitions by running the following commands:\n\n```\nnpm install express\nnpm install @types/express --save-dev\n```\n\nThe `--save-dev` flag is used to save the package for development purposes. Type definitions are not needed in the production environment, so they are saved as a devDependency.\n\nAfter running these commands, your `package.json` file should look something like this:\n\npackage.json\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-app\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"^4.17.1\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/express\": \"^4.17.11\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow, you should be able to import express in your TypeScript files without any issues.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]

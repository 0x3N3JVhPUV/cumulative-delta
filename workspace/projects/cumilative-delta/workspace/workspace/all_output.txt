The error message you're seeing is a TypeScript error. It's telling you that you're trying to use a variable 'error' which has an 'unknown' type. This is a common error when you're trying to handle errors in a try-catch block or in a Promise's .catch() method.

To fix this error, you need to add a type assertion to tell TypeScript what type the 'error' variable is. In most cases, you can assume that 'error' is of type 'any' or 'Error'. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
try {
  // some code that might throw an error
} catch (error: any) {
  // now you can use 'error' variable here
}
```

or

```typescript
try {
  // some code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    // now you can use 'error' variable here
  }
}
```

However, I don't see any try-catch blocks or Promise's .catch() methods in your provided code. So, I can't provide a specific solution. But you can apply the above solutions to your code where you're seeing the error.

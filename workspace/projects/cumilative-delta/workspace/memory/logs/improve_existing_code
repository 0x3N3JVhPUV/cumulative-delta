It's telling you that you're trying to use a variable 'error' which has an 'unknown' type. This is a common error when you're trying to handle errors in a try-catch block or in a Promise's .catch() method.\n\nTo fix this error, you need to add a type assertion to tell TypeScript what type the 'error' variable is. In most cases, you can assume that 'error' is of type 'any' or 'Error'. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```typescript\ntry {\n  // some code that might throw an error\n} catch (error: any) {\n  // now you can use 'error' variable here\n}\n```\n\nor\n\n```typescript\ntry {\n  // some code that might throw an error\n} catch (error) {\n  if (error instanceof Error) {\n    // now you can use 'error' variable here\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, I don't see any try-catch blocks or Promise's .catch() methods in your provided code.

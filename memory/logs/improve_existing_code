Here is a high-level outline of how you might structure your project and implement the required features:\n\n### Step 1: Setup Your NodeJS Project\n\n1. Initialize a new NodeJS project with TypeScript:\n   ```sh\n   npm init -y\n   npm install typescript @types/node --save-dev\n   npx tsc --init\n   ```\n\n2. Include the `kucoin-node-sdk.d.ts` file in your project directory and reference it in your `tsconfig.json` file:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"include\": [\"src/**/*\", \"kucoin-node-sdk.d.ts\"]\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Create API Factory\n\nCreate an API factory that can easily integrate with other exchanges in the future. You might structure it something like this:\n\n```typescript\ninterface ExchangeAPI {\n  getSymbols(): Promise<string[]>;\n  getTradeHistory(symbol: string): Promise<TradeHistory[]>;\n  getCumulativeDelta(symbol: string): Promise<number>;\n}\n\nclass KucoinAPI implements ExchangeAPI {\n  // Implement the methods to interact with Kucoin API\n}\n\nclass ExchangeAPIFactory {\n  static createExchangeAPI(exchange: string): ExchangeAPI {\n    switch (exchange) {\n      case 'kucoin':\n        return new KucoinAPI();\n      // Add cases for other exchanges as you integrate them\n      default:\n        throw new Error('Exchange not supported');\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Implement API Endpoints\n\nUsing a framework like Express, implement the API endpoints as described:\n\n1. Install Express and its types:\n   ```sh\n   npm install express\n   npm install @types/express --save-dev\n   ```\n\n2. Implement the API endpoints:\n\n```typescript\nimport express from 'express';\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get('/exchange/:exchange/symbols', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const exchangeAPI = ExchangeAPIFactory.createExchangeAPI(req.params.exchange);\n    const symbols = await exchangeAPI.getSymbols();\n    res.json(symbols);\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });\n  }\n});\n\napp.get('/exchange/:exchange/trade-history/:symbol', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const exchangeAPI = ExchangeAPIFactory.createExchangeAPI(req.params.exchange);\n    const tradeHistory = await exchangeAPI.getTradeHistory(req.params.symbol);\n    res.json(tradeHistory);\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });\n  }\n});\n\napp.get('/exchange/:exchange/cumulative-delta/:symbol', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const exchangeAPI = ExchangeAPIFactory.createExchangeAPI(req.params.exchange);\n    const cumulativeDelta = await exchangeAPI.getCumulativeDelta(req.params.symbol);\n    res.json({ cumulativeDelta });\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });\n  }\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n### Step 4: Implement Kucoin API Integration\n\nImplement the methods in the `KucoinAPI` class to interact with the Kucoin API. You would use the official Kucoin Node SDK to fetch data and perform calculations.\n\n### Step 5: Testing\n\nEnsure that your implementation is battle-tested by writing comprehensive unit and integration tests.\n\n### Step 6: Deployment\n\nDeploy your API to a production server.\n\nRemember, this is a high-level outline. You would need to implement the details, including error handling, request validation, and integration with the Kucoin API using the official SDK.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "src/index.ts\n```typescript\nimport express from 'express';\nimport { ExchangeAPIFactory } from './factories/exchangeAPIFactory';\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get('/exchange/:exchange/symbols', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const exchangeAPI = ExchangeAPIFactory.createExchangeAPI(req.params.exchange);\n    const symbols = await exchangeAPI.getSymbols();\n    res.json(symbols);\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });\n  }\n});\n\napp.get('/exchange/:exchange/trade-history/:symbol', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const exchangeAPI = ExchangeAPIFactory.createExchangeAPI(req.params.exchange);\n    const tradeHistory = await exchangeAPI.getTradeHistory(req.params.symbol);\n    res.json(tradeHistory);\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });\n  }\n});\n\napp.get('/exchange/:exchange/cumulative-delta/:symbol', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const exchangeAPI = ExchangeAPIFactory.createExchangeAPI(req.params.exchange);\n    const cumulativeDelta = await exchangeAPI.getCumulativeDelta(req.params.symbol);\n    res.json({ cumulativeDelta });\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });\n  }\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nsrc/factories/exchangeAPIFactory.ts\n```typescript\nimport { ExchangeAPI } from '../interfaces/exchangeAPI';\nimport { KucoinAPI } from '../exchanges/kucoinAPI';\n\nexport class ExchangeAPIFactory {\n  static createExchangeAPI(exchange: string): ExchangeAPI {\n    switch (exchange) {\n      case 'kucoin':\n        return new KucoinAPI();\n      // Add cases for other exchanges as you integrate them\n      default:\n        throw new Error('Exchange not supported');\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nsrc/interfaces/exchangeAPI.ts\n```typescript\nexport interface ExchangeAPI {\n  getSymbols(): Promise<string[]>;\n  getTradeHistory(symbol: string): Promise<TradeHistory[]>;\n  getCumulativeDelta(symbol: string): Promise<number>;\n}\n\nexport interface TradeHistory {\n  price: number;\n  volume: number;\n  time: number;\n  isBuyerMaker: boolean;\n}\n```\n\nsrc/exchanges/kucoinAPI.ts\n```typescript\nimport { ExchangeAPI, TradeHistory } from '../interfaces/exchangeAPI';\nimport { Kucoin } from 'kucoin-node-sdk';\n\nexport class KucoinAPI implements ExchangeAPI {\n  private kucoin: Kucoin;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.kucoin = new Kucoin();\n  }\n\n  async getSymbols(): Promise<string[]> {\n    // Implement the method to fetch symbols from Kucoin API\n  }\n\n  async getTradeHistory(symbol: string): Promise<TradeHistory[]> {\n    // Implement the method to fetch trade history from Kucoin API\n  }\n\n  async getCumulativeDelta(symbol: string): Promise<number> {\n    // Implement the method to calculate cumulative delta from trade history\n  }\n}\n```\n\npackage.json\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"cumulative-delta\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"A REST API to calculate the cumulative delta of a specific trading pair.\",\n  \"main\": \"src/index.ts\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"ts-node src/index.ts\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"^4.17.1\",\n    \"kucoin-node-sdk\": \"^1.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/express\": \"^4.17.11\",\n    \"@types/node\": \"^14.14.37\",\n    \"ts-node\": \"^9.1.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^4.2.4\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\ntsconfig.json\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es6\",\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n    \"outDir\": \"./dist\",\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*\", \"kucoin-node-sdk.d.ts\"]\n}\n```", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
